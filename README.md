# Discrete choice modeling with VAEs

## Install
Pyepo: `pip install "git+https://github.com/khalil-research/PyEPO.git#egg=pyepo&subdirectory=pkg"`

## Tests
- Not all the tests in the `tests` directory are `pytest` tests. Some of them, like the VAE and CVAE performance, must be verified qualitiatively and cannot be automated.
